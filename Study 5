This letter is intended to give you more information about the purpose of our research.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between counterfactual thinking and judgements about causality. All of you read a story about a professor and an administrative assistant each taking a pen, causing a problem for the receptionist the next time she needs one. Past research has shown that people think that Professor Smith is a bigger cause of the problem than the administrative assistant.&nbsp; We are examining whether this difference is caused by people thinking about how things could have gone differently. We predict that people think about how Professor Smith could have acted differently, but don't think as much about how the administrative assistant could have acted differently (because he or she was allowed to take a pen, and therefore didn't violate a rule). <br><\/p><p>\n\t&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWe could not tell you the full details of this study prior to your participation because it might have biased your responses.
