R_5j5Jj9GpbdHceJD,2,The same thing would have happened,1,4,4,1,26,1, ,4
R_8xeszCt0ZhZM1A9,2,They might've looked for a new program that would assure the consumer base would shift.,1,2,2,2,29,1, ,2
R_82PCFJM9x1xQyLX,2,He did not seem to care how old his consumer base was. Old or young; profits were all that mattered. If he had wanted an older consumer base; this project certainly duid the trick,2,5,5,1,57,1, ,6
R_ezZMTsYCJwLUU7P,2,The same thing; presumably. Maybe the shift towards an older base would have been stronger if he had wanted it to happen.,5,4,6,1,24,1, ,1
R_299BOUcxGBmJnHn,2,If he had specifically wanted to shift the consumer base then he still would have made the same decision. It wouldn't have made any difference.,1,3,1,1,29,1, ,2
R_cOPIFOOCsCYf7U1,2,He would have been even more for it. Since he didn't care; the fact that the new program would have aligned with his wishes would have made him doubly happy.,5,2,5,1,26,1, ,2
R_9pCWrPsJ3cCHSzr,2,If he wanted this to be a goal rather than an unintended consequence; he might have put more effort into market research to find out how to specifically shift to this consumer base and whether or not it was likely the proposed move would indeed cause the hift.,1,1,1,2,38,1, ,3
R_b7bDyUJcKH99nH7,2,He wanted to make more money and didn't care about the shifting of the  customer base. He was just driven by greed and had no concern for the customers.,3,3,3,2,21,4, ,2
R_5jbaG79RrEFKrTn,2,They would have investigated ways to do so.,4,1,2,1,27,1, ,1
R_3acjwYr9yiAKy8J,2,The chairman didn't care about shifting the consumer base. Had he wanted to; he might have asked for a few tweaks to be put in; but nothing major.,1,1,1,1,28,1, ,1
R_1LocmEYyVsvSfsN,2,If the chairman of the board had wanted to shift the consumer base through the new program; the results may have been different because thiswould have been the aim. The company may have chosen a different program thatmight not have worked to shift the conumer base.,1,1,5,2,35,2, ,2
R_3pZwzexWUojB4Wh,2,The chairman of the board had no strong feelings toward the shifting consumer base; with profit being more important in his eyes. If he wanted to shift the consumer base in this way; the image of the company from the perspective of the public would have canged. The shift also caused the company to become more profitable.,5,2,2,1,26,4, ,2
R_dnfK6BxhxkqzahD,2,If he has wanted to shift the consumer base to be slightly older than the same senario might have happened. He might even have pushed for further marketing and advertising.,2,3,6,2,30,2, ,4
R_6zHrkh7I6fGUgip,2,The chairman of the board didn't care if the consumer based shifted towards an older age group; he just wanted to make profits. I assume if he had specifically wanted the consumer base to shift to an older crowd he would be pleased because after starting he new program the consumer base did just that...shifted to a higher age group. I assume the reasoning behind this is that older people have more disposable income.,2,4,4,2,35,1, ,2
R_6JAJZfn3nlnM9qR,2,The chairman didn't care if the consumer base shifted. If he had said he wanted it to shift; the outcome would probably have been the same.,1,2,1,2,31,1, ,3
R_51I9sikCLziQ7dj,2,I don't see why things would have occurred otherwise; i.e.; the consumer base shifting to an older population. Maybe he would have taken credit for the idea and results. But truly; the chairman was right in only caring about the buck.,1,4,1,1,40,1, ,4
R_7Xad9AYshdyPLOR,2,He may not have cared about the profit. But knowing that it would be profitable would have pleased him had he wanted to make the base older,7,1,2,1,23,1, ,1
R_298a9k5yH9KVywR,2,It would have been good for the company,5,3,1,1,26,1, ,5
R_6uqGeO3klPY3txX,2,There could be changes in the way things are being done because the older consumers will want different things and it can be based on their preferences,5,4,4,2,22,2, ,1
R_bK5k5QlUmXACYBv,2,the consumer will be older rather than younger people but more profit,5,4,5,1,23,3, ,1
R_0B7gynLneDWdWsJ,2,He would have made the decision; and it would have had the same effect; although it might have been even more pronounced because he might have modified the implementation along those lines.,5,2,1,2,30,1, ,3
R_0jl5eDipvqgzpNb,2,The company may have not made the profit it had or possibly even had a decline in profit.,5,5,6,2,51,1, ,3
R_eKUcaDidHJz1SDz,2,I think it would have worked out exactly the same way.,5,5,2,1,52,1, ,4
R_esQtHsSgJv3cfnT,2,If he had wanted to shift the consumer base with the program; he will definitely invest more time on this program and expand it further.,1,4,1,1,23,1, ,2
R_0qt97NfqQ3uxsKF,2,The change would have increased profit and his wishes would have been followed and goal accomplished. He did bot care if the age shifted so he was good with it,2,4,4,1,47,1, ,4
R_57trKAEDvxGC5U1,2,I think the base would have still shifted towards older; but there would have been a more significant increase in the base.,2,1,1,2,31,2, ,2
R_2rdyiP79ZA3hMmV,2,They would still have made profit while moving to a slightly older consumer base.,1,1,1,1,35,4, ,1
R_6nf3xTlj7063vG5,2,I think he doesn't care about anything beside profits. If he did consider wanting to shift the customer base then it was an accident. If he did it purposey he might of lose profits,1,2,1,1,26,4, ,1
R_dmaG1DjE8kLcWpL,2,The same thing that would have happened in this scenario. The proposal led to an older consumer base and more profit; regardless of his interest he would have been supportive of it.,3,2,1,1,29,1, ,1
R_552GynSpm4bFecJ,2,I think he would have still wanted to start the program because it would shift the customer base to be older.,1,3,1,1,45,1, ,2
R_9AAkc9JyM47qho1,2,If he had specifically want to shift the customer base to an older age he may have had the unintended consequence of increasing profits as well.,1,1,1,1,24,1, ,1
R_es8wqjhtjYpaq3j,2,The same thing would probably have happened; assuming he was presented with the same proposal which would have the effect of attracting an older customer base.,2,1,1,1,35,4, ,2
R_3mbJ3vVNia7s0bX,2,I think the main motivation is just the money. He just wanted to make as much money as possible regardless.,6,2,1,1,24,4, ,1
R_aW5F5KXgaoUSIlv,2,He did not care whether or not the consumer base shifted; he just cared about the bottom line of the company. If he specifically wanted to shift the cosumer base he could've said he wanted this or been more eager to implement the change that shifts the ag of the consumer,4,3,2,1,24,4, ,3
R_2g8SlJTwZBwU1Ct,2,He didn't care if his customer base shifted toward older consumers. The chairman just wanted to increase profits.,5,3,1,2,26,1, ,2
R_a3ovfV7rUMLk6ON,2,He would have still chosen to go ahead with the plan and succeeded at that as well.,2,3,1,2,33,1, ,3
R_29ROq2fYHJMV7QF,2,The thing he could have done most of all would be to stagnate his product line and not change it much; other than tweaks and rebrandings here and there within the same product; so that people sort of grow old with them and thus you have your older demograhics.,1,6,4,1,28,1, ,3
R_elGVJx0JDQPpUK9,2,He would have been more polite with the VP; possibly told him it's a good idea; and why he thought so.,2,2,2,1,33,1, ,1
R_bee0XaM8VRSPudL,2,If he wanted to shift the consumer base to and older base then the company would still profit.,3,3,1,1,26,4, ,1
R_eytd5JIM2QHLpaJ,2,He would have made the same choice since the side effect of shifting the costumer base to older would have been achieved in either case,1,1,1,1,32,1, ,2
R_e5lIn0i5UuYqg5f,2,If he focused on changing the consumer base; he may have alienating his original consumer base. If they changed the product or the advertising to focus more on older people; the younger people that enjoyed the product may have felt left out and abandoned he prodcut. By bringing in another consumer base; instead of replacing the old one. They saw success.,1,3,1,1,24,1, ,2
R_8CbJbnTE9ZSESeV,2,If he wanted to shift the base older; he had a good excuse to do so because they company also made profits from it. He could have said the same thing,6,1,1,1,28,1, ,2
R_8Inps3sCxfzl3WR,2,I think the same thing would have happened; although possibly it would have shifted even further towards having an older consumer base than it already did.,1,1,1,1,29,1, ,1
R_55tRA744jrHRcLX,2,I don't' think it would have made a difference either way since he went ahead and changed the consumer base anyway based on his profit needs.,2,1,1,1,23,1, ,1
R_40mTuMqtykjahDv,2,I don't believe there would've been an appeal if it was only towards the older groups.  By making a profit using the method he was thinking; he attracted both older and younger groups.  The market did naturally increase the shift towards older groups.,5,4,5,1,30,1, ,2
R_6lZeOysRGDrmbEV,2,He would have been even happier with the outcome because it did shift the consumer base how it had been predicted and increased profits at the same time.,1,4,5,2,35,1, ,2
R_bfOYETtaPwVwVNz,2,If the chairman of the board was actually concerned with shifting their consumer base to a slightly older demographic; he/she might've asked the vice-president for specific courses of action they could take towards achieving that goal.,1,2,1,1,20,4, ,2
R_5u2dzVFHEolzhhr,2,I don't think it would have made much difference if he wanted to shift the consumer base. He still decided to go along with a plan that he knew would shift it.,5,2,5,2,30,1, ,1
R_a4CmGV93X9c3CV7,2,Well he would have been pleased since that's what the new program did anyway. He still would have said to go ahead with the new program.,4,3,1,1,35,1, ,2
R_3kEOLSAD6XEQqu9,2,If the chair had wanted to shift the consumer base to be slightly older he would have acted in the same manner; by approving the program.  However; the chairman should be concerned with maximizing profits; therefor he acted appropriately.,1,5,2,1,41,1, ,6
R_0rCEp55tDiSH34F,2,I believe the shift would have occured. By putting the burden on his subordinates to make more profit; he showed that his leadership was not very good. He didn't take an active role; but if he had; the entire company may be more profitable because everyon would have been working in that direction.,2,4,1,1,61,1, ,2
R_1Gp6ht6hWtcGR6t,2,There might have been an add campaign and marketing strategy tailored to an older demographic.   It could affect packagingm; avail;ability; salesforce; customer service; logistics; in short; nearly every aspect of the business.,2,4,4,1,55,1, ,4
R_39Ra9DUEXuY3ukZ,2,Things would have turned out in the same way if he had specifically wanted to shift the consumer base in this way.,1,1,1,1,35,1, ,2
R_5sX64EfQryjJRtj,2,This chairman obviously only cares about making money. He will go with whatever plan will make the most profit.,4,2,1,1,36,1, ,2
R_0D1IQIwCWxSh2F7,2,I think the outcome would have been the same. His intentions would not have affected the outcome.,2,2,1,2,66,1, ,4
R_250b128XGQCnHXn,2,It would have had a better influence.,3,5,5,2,30,3, ,2
R_9zZCQaCk7b8oMhT,2,If he had specifically wanted to shift the consumer base in this way; the outcome would have been the same.  Only his intentions would have been different.  The consumer base would have still shifted.,1,1,1,2,31,1, ,4
R_bdrdG8CasEEUSHP,2,The chairman did not have a very nice attitude; he just wanted to make more money; he also did not care about the consumer shift to older people. If he had wanted the shift he may have enjoyed better profits.,2,4,5,2,68,2, ,1
R_73PkFivHWr0uMrX,2,If he had wanted to shift the consumer base older; he would have acted in the same way. He know it would shift older; but it was only a byproduct of his desire.,2,3,1,1,26,1, ,3
R_6mmCs9bOO1Ie5CZ,2,They woudl lose some customers but that is probably ok since they are older and need to new poeple.,7,2,1,1,35,1, ,4
R_09uYictpkb3kbyt,2,If he wanted to shift the consumer base this way; he would have been happy with the result.,2,3,2,1,27,1, ,1
R_0TjOk4YyEqo96BL,2,He would lose profits; because he would not be marketing to other ages.,6,2,5,2,35,1, ,4
R_byfjJIfap3kjDW5,2,If he had wanted the customer base to be that way; the company would have made more money.,3,3,1,1,21,1, ,1
R_9QuEDYx5bQ47vNj,2,I'm not sure. It could be something to do with his personal life influencing him to do this.,5,3,2,1,24,1, ,1
R_6QflaodYRMyVGAZ,2,it seems like he would have gotten the same result either way,2,1,2,2,32,1, ,1
R_9oc6a4Uera00yhf,2,If he had wanted to shift the customer base to old people; it might have worked. He was 't really interested in his customer base; just the profit.,1,6,6,2,66,1, ,2
R_bd5b7VCDOpfNyqp,2,he wouldnt have cared cause it increased profits,3,3,5,1,20,1, ,1
R_bdNowPXbawsaHWd,2,The chairman of the board seemed to be only interested in only profits. If the chairman had a reason to believe that increasing the target age to be older would increase profits.,5,1,1,2,31,2, ,1
R_erBUNOn0HLyWeAl,2,HE DID NOT CARE AT ALL. HE WANTS MONEY ABOVE ALL ELSE. IF HE HAD WANTED TO SHIFT THE CONSUMER BASE HE WOULD HAVE TOLD THE VP AND BEEN MORE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE IDEA.,2,4,1,1,29,1, ,2
R_4Mn0rXiwVgPaxiR,2,If the chairman of the board had specifically wanted to shift the consumer base in this way; there may have been a more drastic shift as attitudes would be inclined towards shifting and not toward profit development.,4,4,5,1,24,4, ,1
R_eKCJO0IFH10tOpD,2,The shift in consumer base happened with him not even caring about it; so I think it would have had the same outcome especially if he specifically wanted to shift the consumer base.,2,4,5,2,32,1, ,1
R_a4cTcUPfI0YbYCF,2,He would have felt partially responsble for the increased profits.,2,1,1,1,33,1, ,2
R_4NtH0YMs0JqxhVH,2,In all likelihood; the exact same sequence of events would have occurred if the Chairman had wanted to shift the consumer based a bit older. This plan would have that effect; plus increase revenue. It would have been a double win.,2,3,1,1,25,4, ,2
R_bp8gc3lWAEGdcUZ,2,The attitude of the chairman was very clear. He said ?I don?t care at all about shifting our consumer base to be slightly older.  I just want to make as much profit as I can. Let?s start the new program.? As such; shifting was inconsequential to te profits. However; he the chairman decide he specifically wanted to shift the consumer base; then this program served to meet both his goals; the 1)older customer base and 2) profits.,1,1,1,1,32,1, ,3
R_6YHTXHcGCE7FOrX,2,There might have been increase cost to shift to consumer base.,3,2,1,1,28,1, ,1
R_3gZHM20xCOjOJ4F,2,He wants to make the most profit possible so he doesn't care who he sells to as long as he sells. He has a care free approach and did littler consideration of the situation.,6,2,1,1,27,1, ,1
R_dgtxac7fEDfM3gV,2,If he specifically wanted to shift to older demographics; it would not make as much sense to me. Making profits is good for the company; but targetting an always shrinking demographic is not a good idea.,2,3,4,1,24,1, ,1
R_etBbHXPmenXx9Ep,2,He would've gotten praised and credit for doing so; since he would be directly following the Vice President's orders,5,3,2,1,28,4, ,3
R_afOm9HKYErrId4p,2,I THINK THE SAME THING WOULD HAVE HAPPENED. THEY WOULD HAVE STARTED THE NEW PROGRAM AND STARTED MAKING A BIGGER PROFIT AND THEIR CONSUMER BASE WOULD HAVE SHIFTED TO SLIGHTLY OLDER PEOPLE. MAYBE IF THEY ACTIVELY WANTED TO SHIFT THEIR BASE IT WOULD HAVE GOTEN MORE MONEY BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE CATERING MORE TO THAT GROUP AND WOULD HAVE A BIGGER NUMBER OF CONSUMERS.,2,4,6,2,23,1, ,2
R_6hPwChwuKvKDUt7,2,If his goal was to shift the consumer base in the same way; it would have had little effect on what happened. They would have started the new program and had gotten more profits. The motivations would have been different; but the results would have been te same.,3,3,4,1,24,1, ,4
R_bfpiGtccSTmM1Mh,2,If the chairman had wanted to specifically shift the consumer base to older; the same result would have been achieved:  increased profits.,7,2,1,1,41,1, ,3
R_3EHaD1MvNo9ENXn,2,The chaiman should think long term. To be able to shift the consumer base is a good asset to have also long as it will continue to benefit the company.,4,5,5,2,34,2, ,2
R_bjCKb2G11ESr03P,2,It wouldn't have changed anything. If he wanted to he would have gotten the same results; as that was the strategy to begin with.,4,6,3,1,27,1, ,3
R_6eWV3CrGE3rysHr,2,He did not care about shifting the consumer base as long as he could make as large a profit as he could. Nothing different would have happened if he had specifically wanted to shift the consumer base to an older one.,1,1,1,2,24,4, ,1
R_e2PynNm2AawCBgN,2,everything would have happened the same way,2,2,1,1,30,4, ,1
R_daqVLVMKqLIaZlr,2,He must have noticed that the majority of the money coming into the  company was coming from an older consumer population.,6,4,6,1,28,1, ,5
R_0okv9uptZgiDoOh,2,He would have been even more enthusiastic about the proposal and might have rewarded the VP.,2,3,1,1,25,1, ,2
R_eeCcfMqnv2ssxbD,2,The chairman didn't care much--he just wanted profits to increase.  If he HAD specifically wanted to shift the customer base; the end result probably would have been much the same.,1,4,3,2,35,1, ,3
R_8eUARkj7TxTKSC9,2,If he had specifically wanted the consumer base to be older than nothing would have changed.,2,3,1,1,25,1, ,3
R_5C30DEH8Ia2n3Jr,2,If he had wanted to shift the consumer base in the way described then he would have made the same decision. The only difference is that he would be even more likely to decide on the same course of action. He probably would have felt a little bit better abut it as well.,1,3,2,1,26,1, ,1
R_1TimajHZ8hzGcfz,2,then it would be a conscious decision instead of side effect of an action however the end results would be about the same,4,2,1,1,30,4, ,1
R_eD9E5jT1xNoK9md,2,IF HE HAD SPECIFICALLY WANTED TO SHIFT THE CONSUMER BASE IT WOULD HAVE HAD THE SAME RESULT; AND MAYBE EVEN MORE SO.  THE SHIFT WAS SIDE RESULT OF HIS MAIN FOCUS HAD IT BEEN THE PRIMARY FOCUS THE RESULTING SHIFT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN MORE MAGNIFIED,3,1, ,1,43,3, ,2
R_3mWQdn52ouEa6b3,2,He would have made the same decision because it would also make the company more profitable.,5,1,1,1,31,1, ,5
R_1NSDiNRssLIF0aN,2,The consumer base would shift to a slightly older one meaning that the average age of the consumer would be higher than before.,2,3,2,1,20,4, ,2
R_8cvsWGkL7oQCbA1,2,The chairman sounds like an ill-tempered bozo. However; it doesn't seem like his attitude made a difference in the outcome.,1,2,1,1,58,1, ,3
R_bvgxQpOw0i9r62F,2,If he wanted to shift the consumer base to older they might have spent a lot of money trying to figure out what older people wanted and done a lot of research. Instead now they are inadvertently shifting their consumer base and increasing profit,1,2,1,2,21,1, ,1
R_54na2JZ0wpRPspv,2,After it worked; he may have taken more credit for the sucess instead of just going along with it.,2,3,1,1,28,3, ,1
R_1MORQj7KCvw2BFz,2,If he had specifically wanted to shift the consumer base in this way and had been forward-thinking with this idea 5 years earlier; he would have proposed the change himself and now would be sititng on a lot more money.,2,6,6,2,39,1, ,2
R_blPlwrd7SRbIh13,2,The chairman seemed indifferent and just wanted to present an idea. The VP seemed to act poorly though,3,3,3,1,23,1, ,1
R_aaOKS0GmNYeziXr,2,I think instead; he would have expressed that the entire plan was a great idea; rather than expressing that he did not care about the shift to an older consumer base.,1,3,1,2,29,2, ,2
R_4ONDJtiPHrbnH2R,2,I think the same thing would have happened if he wanted to shift the consumer base. Why would it be any different?,5,4,3,1,25,1, ,3
R_0cxky9uuF5J9Zl3,2,Well my guess is that they see more profit on whatever they do since the vice president said that the new program will shift their consumer base but it will also yield higher profits,7,4,2,1,22,3, ,2
R_3a8L6oAbhyWuvPL,2,He didn't really care what was going to happen with the consumer base; all he cared about was profit. So if it made him a profit he was happy. If he wanted the consumer base to shift the way it did; he would be extremely happy.,1,2,1,1,31,1, ,2
R_8FWUC2d5B9l9qO9,2,If he had wanted to shift the costumer base to older; he would have made the same choice.,2,2,1,1,30,1, ,2
R_3DBsGQgbBRcV8VL,2,I don't think anything would have changed.  The VP wanted both profits and shifting of the consumer base.  They both went hand in hand in my opinion.  Because of the older consumer base; they were able to get more profit.,3,2,1,1,30,4, ,2
R_e2NuUraag3iGmCV,1,Arrogant business man. Not caring for the customers and consumers. He's only worried about keeping his business profit as high as possible; which is understandable.,1,4,1,1,22,2, ,1
R_5j6Spa6UjIoEHBj,1,Could take steps to avoid doing so,4,2,1,1,32,1, ,1
R_4Z2Dl1ArVIxq6nb,1,He could have asked if they could have still made as much profit with another plan without shifting the consumer base.,1,6,1,1,30,2, ,1
R_2iCRZBMGg48o3J3,1,He could have changed his attitude! He might have a much BETTER consumer base ; not to mention employees this way!,4,4,5,2,28,1, ,1
R_er4q9v7NOSZqDKR,1,He could have tailored strategies towards younger consumer bases to help raise profits.,3,2,1,2,30,1, ,2
R_3xjo1GxqB4JfB2d,1,He didn't care about shifting the consumer base age; just wanted to make money. If he specifically wanted to avoid shifting it; he would have missed out on further profit.,1,1,1,1,26,1, ,3
R_0pvjWsqs1gVJma9,1,He didn't care about shifting the consumer base; he just wanted to increase profits. If he specifically wanted to avoid shifting the consumer base in this way; they would not have increased profits.,4,2,1,2,22,4, ,1
R_26uyt3ymQJkBM45,1,He doesn't care as long as it makes him money. But if he wanted a youthful demographic; maybe that would be better because he'd make more money in the long run as the youth aged and continue using his product. He would thus avoid making money in the shortterm but make more in the long-term; maybe.,3,2,1,2,29,4, ,1
R_5gx3HrPiIYRYgsZ,1,He may have lost money,1,1,3,1,24,1, ,2
R_3rqQvGF3FdS2Ysd,1,He may have made less money,1,2,2,2,22,1, ,4
R_5ph6ZjmlYKcyqGN,1,He might have chosen to change the program to be geared to attracting younger consumers.,1,5,1,2,41,1, ,1
R_bd8choc3kOK6dgN,1,He might have said; I don't feel comfotable shifting the consumer base. Is there a way we can keep our consumer base the same and still increase profits?,6,2,5,2,27,1, ,2
R_8oV65T1nmgNyEzr,1,He might have suggested a change in program direction to target his preferred consumer base directly.,1,3,1,1,28,1, ,1
R_eXyWg1dDTsUMmcR,1,He might not have increased his profits because he didn't want to shift the consumer base. The program wouldn't have happend and they might have continued being profitable but they wouldn't  make more profit the way that they would have if they shifted th consumer base to be slightly older.,7,6,4,2,41,1, ,3
R_516bmwu2sHhRx2J,1,He most likely would only avoid shifting the customer base if it meant he would make less money. I feel he was only after the pursuit on dollars.,3,4,2,1,19,1, ,1
R_89fyHw1JovxU1OB,1,He most likely wouldn't have been looked upon too kindly. He probably would have been out voted and then not liked very much. There is a reason the board wanted to go in that direction.,4,3,2,1,27,1, ,1
R_9MJ0s0kPtqt157D,1,He probably would've avoided starting the new program.,1,3,1,1,24,4, ,1
R_5suh0QgKRrAekG9,1,He sounds like a jerk; first of all. I don't know why they wouldn't want an elderly base? And; had they not wanted it; it wouldn't have happened. Not with that guy running the company.,6,3,3,2,29,1, ,1
R_0Oi7JfEMCBqQdFP,1,He wanted to make as much many as possible and didn't really care about how they went about that.,3,5,3,1,21, , ,4
R_5uQuftYmS3yD38N,1,He was all for shifting the consumer base; which is beneficial.  If he wanted to avoid it; it may not benefit the company,6,4,5,2,26,1, ,2
R_bl4eqTfpRFTgyWh,1,He was pretty stuborn. If he wasn't stubborn and so money hungry then he could have prevented a shift from happening.,7,4,1,1,27,1, ,3
R_0VNtPOxc79F9m3X,1,He would be upset; since the consumer based would have shifted even though he didn't want it to. He may have then stopped the programs so that it would stop shifting the consumer base; and he may try to shift the consumer base back towards what it was befre.,1,4,2,1,19,1, ,1
R_0vqH3MB2TRO5Eah,1,He would have been against profits and seemed contrarian.,3,1,1,1,26,2, ,4

R_8pm6J8dNXoNklG5,1,He would have been faced with a more difficult decision to make - whether or not more profit was worth doing something he wanted to avoid. I feel that he would ask for opinions and eventually go for the higher profits.,3,3,2,1,26,1, ,1
R_25d4Fa6ED1RA65n,1,He would have changed the price of the product so more young people could afford to buy more of it. He may have changed packaging and advertising.,7,1,2,2,19,2, ,6

R_eCGuyfA097BgMKx,1,He would have probably fought against it to prevent the base from shifting.,3,3,1,1,25,1, ,1
R_bPzwyUwUCZGKSCp,1,He would have put some effort into researching how it would affect his consumer base and what he could do about it.  He would have seemed to have more interest and invest more in the details of the new program to try to adjust it.,1,3,1,1,24,4, ,3
R_e2wGr4FuSsYXJaJ,1,He would have said he valued the youth of his consumer base over profits; and refused to start the new program.,2,1,1,2,54,1, ,1

R_efluPAzwPODPBSR,1,He would have vetoed the idea.,5,1,1,2,35,1, ,4

R_8wgTxO8gD1gJ2sJ,1,He would not have worried about profits; so he would not have changed things the way the vice president wanted to and profits would not have increased.,2,4,2,2,31,1, ,1
R_9L8AoZU33f3fgfX,1,He wouldn't have been able to move forward with the program. If it is likely to shift the consumer base; it wouldn't have been a good idea to move forward with it. He would've had to come up with a new plan in order to avoid the shifting.,2,3,6,2,28,2, ,2
R_3xdl2UWc4qog6KV,1,His profits would not have risen and his job may have been in jeopardy. He simply wanted increased profits and his job security.,7,3,4,1,37,1, ,3
R_eX6zE7TllIOJmwB,1,I don't think that he necessarily wanted to avoid shifting the consumer base; he just wanted to increase profits. The fact that it shifted his consumer base wasn't a big deal to him.,3,5,5,2,20,1, ,1
R_7VXzLqYnfWcSLCR,1,I just wanted more profit and didn't care about anything else. Doesn't matter to him if consumers are old or young. If he avoided shifting consumer base to slightly older; he would lose out on profits.,7,4,1,1,33,1, ,2

R_4HFjuZgSrfVElvL,1,I think that he would have been viewed as ageist.,1,1,1,2,23,1, ,1
R_blM0toMAOEcb4C9,1,I think there would have been an argument on the profitability of the new program compared to other options. It's clear the chairman's priority is maximum profits so he would argue why the new program wouldn't be as profitable as others,4,3,1,1,32,4, ,2
R_9BmxoRH7ONhW405,1,I think they wouldn't have made as much money. An older consumer base was the result of the change to make more money.,2,2,1,1,22,1, ,3
R_a3jykRheaRWyV3D,1,I would assume that if he had been concerned about the consumer base shifting he would have rejected starting a new program; even if it meant an increase in profits.

R_5ySsQ8LWC0jUvjL,1,If he didn't want to shift the consumer base toward being older; it would probably be because older consumer bases won't be as profitable for as long. In the short term they would lose profits; but in the long term maybe not so.,4,1,1,1,28,1, ,3
R_9GEXCePvJVksWq1,1,If he had resisted shifting the consumer base at the expense of greater profit he probably would have lost his job given the way many companies are run.

R_1KNwXFDUsFcVS6h,1,If he had wanted the consumer base to remain the same; he would have nixed the project. He only acted the way he did because he was more focused on immediate profit than on long term repercussions.,2,2,5,1,27,1, ,2

R_7UNnZFTECb9TmAJ,1,If he had wanted to avoid shifting the consumer base than they would not have started the new program. They would have either had to stick to the old program; or come up with a new one.,4,4,1,1,30,1, ,2
R_1za05SWBGT6JzY9,1,If he had wanted to avoid shifting the consumer base this way he may have lost profits unless he came up with a creative solution to bring in more profits while mantaining the former consumer base.

R_eyyjRhmy7VdpBgp,1,If he had wanted to avoid shifting the consumer base; he would have passed on making better profits for the company. He also might be accused of discrimination toward that consumer base; because what company wouldn't aim to make a profit?,4,2,1,2,35,1, ,2

R_a5xx8p7AGdJ0eKF,1,If he wanted to avoid shifting the consumer base in this way he would not have agreed to the new plan.  Instead; the chairman may have initiated a different plan to shift to a younger consumer base; or not shift it at all.,5,2,1,1,27,1, ,1
R_5jRTvRwewYto7eB,1,If he wanted to avoid shifting the consumer base then he would probably have declined the new idea. Either that or he would have given some time to think about it and work around the consumer shift problem.,4,3,1,1,23,4, ,1

R_a8yWm1pQx0OhsAR,1,If he wanted to avoid shifting the consumer base; the vice president probably wouldn't have been too pleased.

R_8icBguVKCbCb541,1,If the chairman had wished to avoid shifting the consumer base older; he would've proposed an alternative to the new venture that may not have boosted profits as much (or at all) but would've ensured that the consumer base didn't shift either way. The atttude currently is cavalier; reckless; concerned only with profits and not at all with long-term repercussions or methodology.,6,4,6,1,29,1, ,2
R_e36Z3Jv3uWl6oVD,1,If the chairman hadn't wanted to shift his customer base older he might have turned down the decision even though it would result in less profit in the short-term.

R_3O6KZBrNxVmH325,1,Seems like the chairman is a little too preoccupied with profits only.  Can't blame him but he seem only one-directional and not one to see the total picture much.
